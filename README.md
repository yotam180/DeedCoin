# DeedCoin
A shared school project for code examples and libraries to use.

DeedCoin is a website for virtual cash based e-commerce. The idea is - first, contribute or offer services. Then - earn deedcoins, and 
only then - spend them on other people's services (gigs).

Firstly give, then receive.

# Technical side

The website uses Visual Basic ASP.NET with the LiteDB library. You may take any stylesheet, webpage template or code for your website, with or
without any given credit, with a few exceptions:

1. Do NOT use the name Deedcoin or the product logo in any other project unrelated to DeedCoin
2. Do NOT use materials from this website for other websites with the exact same purpose as DeedCoin (if you have any confusions about that one,
 contact me at yotam.salmon@gmail.com)
 
# Notes

This website is only a school project, it will probably not be hosted anywhere or actually work, but as it contains a lot of usable code,
I share it here as it might help others.

Cheers!
