Passing the Israeli question to the UN

1. Britain knew that partitioning the land of Israel would cause an Arab rebellion that would be directed at Britain. That why Britain
preferred to pass the Israeli question to the UN, to keep its relations with the Arabs.
2. After WWII, Britain was weak, economically an politically, and needed the help of the US. Britain couldn't continue refusing about the
argument of the פליטים and displaced, and in order to receive American support, they passed the decision to the UN.
3. The acts of terror in Israel embittered the Britsh lives in Israel and Britain was forced to turn to the UN to find its way of honor.
4. According to the International Law, Britain was forced to pass the subject to the UN decision, since it had to receive a renewed power
of attorney from the UN for its mandate.
5. Britain wanted to "gain time" and assumed that because of the "Cold War", the UN won't be able to consolidate an agreeable solution, and
it would have to ask Britain to continue its mandate on Israel, so Britain can evade the Balfor declaration.
